This mod is for Victoria 3 (by Paradox Interactive). Steam description below (WIP)

# Mod Description
This mod aims to add diversity of gameplay related to different world religions via modifications to in-game religions, new and improved devout interest group ideologies, and new laws.

## New Religions
- Anglicanism and Confucianism have been added to the game, and the Atheist religion has been relabelled as 'Humanism'.
- Religious traits have been reconfigured for all in-game religions.

## New Laws
- A new law in the Church and State group (Religious Tolerance) accepts all religions with any trait in common with the State Religion. Freedom of Conscience is reworked to only accept religions with a similar heritage trait (eg. Christian, Muslim, Buddhist)
- New religious law options for policing and bureaucracy that pit landowner and religious interests against each other.
- A new religious welfare law supported by Sikh and Hindu religions.

## Reworked State Atheism mechanics
- The newly-renamed Humanism(Atheism), Confucianism, and Buddhist religions all have an 'Atheist' trait.
- Any country with an 'Atheist' state religion may adopt State Atheism without changing their existing State Religion.
- Countries with a theist state religion will have their State Relgion changed to Humanism when adopting State Atheism, but can regain their original state religion back if they move away from State Atheism.
- Countries with a Humanist state religion will see the Devout interest group deactivated (though the Minority Faiths interest group will gain power to oppose the State Atheism law.)

## Interest Groups and Ideologies
- More than 20 new ideologies have been added, and each in-game religion has a unique ideological makeup. Most have several distinct localizations as well to add additional flavor on top of varied gameplay.
- Devout interest group attraction has been reworked (inspired by the Better Interest Group Attraction mod) to account for the different ideological configurations of each religion and each countries current laws.
- New 'Minority Faiths' interest group is enabled in all countries without the State Religion law. This interest group draws from non-state religions and opposes state-sanctioned religious laws. It is especially attractive to religious pops in a country with the State Atheism law.
