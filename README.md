This mod is for Victoria 3 (by Paradox Interactive). Steam description below (WIP)

# Mod Description
This mod aims to add diversity of gameplay related to different world religions via modifications to in-game religions, new and improved devout interest group ideologies, and new laws.

## New Religion
- Anglicanism has been added to the game, and the Atheist religion has been relabelled as 'Humanism'.
- Religious traits have been reconfigured for all in-game religions.

## New Laws
- A new law in the Church and State group (Religious Tolerance) accepts all religions with any trait in common with the State Religion. Freedom of Conscience is reworked to only accept religions with a similar heritage trait (eg. Christian, Muslim, Buddhist)
- New religious law options for policing and bureaucracy that pit landowner and religious interests against each other.
- A new religious welfare law supported by Sikh and Hindu religions.

## Unique Ideologies
- 40 new ideologies have been added, and each in-game religion has a unique ideological makeup. Some religions have several distinct localizations as well to add additional flavor on top of varied gameplay.

## New Minority Faith Interest Group
- Enabled in all countries without the State Religion law
- Dynamically calculated and updated periodically based on the religious makeup of the country to represent the most populous non-state religion
- Unique ideologies for each in-game religion that oppose state religious control over the areas like schooling that the faith tradition is most interested in
- Draws from the country's minority religion, or from any pop under the State Atheism law

## Reworked State Atheism mechanics
- The newly-renamed Humanism(Atheism), Confucianism, and Buddhist religions all have an 'Atheist' trait.
- Any country with an 'Atheist' state religion may adopt State Atheism without changing their existing State Religion.
- Countries with a theist state religion will have their State Religion changed to Humanism when adopting State Atheism, but can regain their original state religion back if they move away from State Atheism.
- Countries with a Humanist state religion will see the Devout interest group deactivated (though the Minority Faith interest group will be more popular under State Atheism).
